

I,,

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.



I,,

Speak, if you can: what are you?



I,,

Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;...



I,,

Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!



I,,

Your children shall be kings.



I,,

And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?



I,,

The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?



I,,

[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind....



I,,

[Aside]. Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act...



I,,

[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.



I,,

[Aside] Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.



I,,

Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains...



I,,

Till then, enough. Come, friends.



I,,

The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part...



I,,

The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful...



I,,

[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,...



I,,

My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.



I,,

To-morrow, as he purposes.



I,,

We will speak further.



I,,

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination...



I,,

Hath he ask'd for me?



I,,

We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought...



I,,

Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;...



I,,

If we should fail?



I,,

Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose...



I,,

I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat....



II,,

A friend.



II,,

Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect;...



II,,

I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,...



II,,

If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honour for you.



II,,

Good repose the while!



II,,

Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed....



II,,

[Within] Who's there? what, ho!



II,,

I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?



II,,

When?



II,,

As I descended?



II,,

Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?



II,,

This is a sorry sight.



II,,

There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
'Murder!'...



II,,

One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands....



II,,

But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'...



II,,

Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,...



II,,

Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor...



II,,

I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;...



II,,

Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?...



II,,

To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
[Knocking within]...



II,,

Good morrow, both.



II,,

Not yet.



II,,

I'll bring you to him.



II,,

The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.



II,,

He does: he did appoint so.



II,,

'Twas a rough night.



II,,

[with Lennox] What's the matter.



II,,

What is 't you say? the life?



II,,

Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,...



II,,

You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood...



II,,

O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.



II,,

Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:...



II,,

Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.



III,,

Here's our chief guest.



III,,

To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
And I'll request your presence.



III,,

Ride you this afternoon?



III,,

We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,...



III,,

Fail not our feast.



III,,

We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
In England and in Ireland, not confessing...



III,,

I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell....



III,,

Bring them before us.
[Exit Attendant]...



III,,

Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know...



III,,

I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find...



III,,

Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,...



III,,

Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.



III,,

So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts...



III,,

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;...



III,,

I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
[Exeunt Murderers]...



III,,

We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice...



III,,

So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;...



III,,

O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.



III,,

There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown...



III,,

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,...



III,,

You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.



III,,

Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host....



III,,

See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:...



III,,

'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?



III,,

Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,...



III,,

Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,...



III,,

Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled...



III,,

Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,...



III,,

Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;...



III,,

The table's full.



III,,

Where?



III,,

Which of you have done this?



III,,

Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.



III,,

Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.



III,,

Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
how say you?...



III,,

If I stand here, I saw him.



III,,

Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;...



III,,

I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,...



III,,

Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;...



III,,

What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,...



III,,

Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,...



III,,

It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;...



III,,

How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?



III,,

I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house...



III,,

Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:...



IV,,

How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?



IV,,

I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:...



IV,,

Call 'em; let me see 'em.



IV,,

Tell me, thou unknown power,â€”



IV,,

Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one...



IV,,

Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.



IV,,

Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,...



IV,,

That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree...



IV,,

I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know....



IV,,

Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,...



IV,,

Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!...



IV,,

Saw you the weird sisters?



IV,,

Came they not by you?



IV,,

Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear...



IV,,

Fled to England!



IV,,

Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook...



V,,

Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,...



V,,

Geese, villain!



V,,

Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?...



V,,

Take thy face hence.
[Exit Servant]...



V,,

What news more?



V,,

I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.



V,,

I'll put it on.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;...



V,,

Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,...



V,,

Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff....



V,,

Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,...



V,,

Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength...



V,,

I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd...



V,,

She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word....



V,,

Well, say, sir.



V,,

Liar and slave!



V,,

If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,...



V,,

They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he...



V,,

Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.



V,,

My name's Macbeth.



V,,

No, nor more fearful.



V,,

Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,...



V,,

Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes...



V,,

Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged...



V,,

Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air...



V,,

Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!...



V,,

I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,...
